# Payment-gateway
<ul>
<li>In this project, I have created a simple website where payment is integrated.</li>
<li>When the project is opened, the main page/home page appears in which a small message is written and below it, there is this Donate button, which when clicked, leads to the page where the user can donate his/her share of amount.</li>
<li>There is also a tab in the home page called ‘Leave a Message’ which when clicked, leads to a page where user can leave a sweet message for those underprivileged.</li>
<li>There is another tab on homepage called ‘Know More’ which will lead to a page will give info to user about the poor condition of the Covid Victims.</li>
</ul>
